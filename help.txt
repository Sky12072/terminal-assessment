Hi future traveler!

Feeling lost how to use this app?
Glad you asked for a help, this document is here for you when needed.

A scenary of a mountain or country could look very different with each of its beauty. 
This app is an app that helps users to decide their travel destination based on particular seasons in certain months. 
The users will be able to select their favourite countries and save them in a wishlist for their further research or simply their final decision. 
Additionally, the app also suggest activity ideas for indoor or outdoor for travel inspiration. 

In the database, there are 48 most travelled countries accross 8 continents and seasons of each month within the year. 

I really hope this app will help you to narrow down which country best to travel that is more suitable time and preferred season.
Good luck and bon voyage!
